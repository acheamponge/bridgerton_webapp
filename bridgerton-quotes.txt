I know you must think me a fool but my heart pays no heed to mere logic.
It is you I cannot sacrifice.

I know you must think me a fool but my heart pays no head to mere logic.

Her heart is no matter, as long as her hand remains free.
Why must our only options be to squawk and settle or to never leave the nest? What if I want to fly?

Daphne Bridgerton: “If you say she is the one in whose presence you cannot properly think or even breathe. If you say you feel that feeling.
Lord Anthony Bridgerton: “Feeling? What-
Daphne Bridgerton: “The one that makes it impossible for you to look away from them at any given moment.

We are not all guaranteed a fairy-tale ending.
True love is something else entirely. It is when the rest of the world goes quiet. It is not eyes that meet, but souls that dance. Settle into each other. Make room for each other. Until there is nowhere else to hide.
It should not be a luxury, but a right to choose, to fight for the family that you want.
I am certain you will find your purpose one day. Everyone must eventually.

The only thing that would disappoint me is seeing you starting to care what anyone else thinks. That would not be you.
Just keep looking at me. No one else matters.
I love you. I’ve loved you from the moment we raced each other in that park. I’ve loved you at every dance, on every walk, every time we’ve been together and every time we’ve been apart. You do not have to accept it, you do not have to embrace it, or even allow it. Knowing you, you probably will not. But, you must know it, in your heart. You must feel it because I do. I love you.
I know I am imperfect, but I will humble myself before you because I cannot imagine my life without you.
If you desire the sun and the moon all you have to do is go out and shoot at the sky. Some of us cannot.
